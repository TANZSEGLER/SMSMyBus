This project is a civic hacking project that makes the Madison Metro bus system more accessible.

The primary goal is to provide access to real-time arrival estimates via a 
variety of mobile interfaces - SMS, chat, email and phone. This project also includes an API that abstracts this work.

All of the ugly screen scraping hacks are here. Some code is used. Others is not.
